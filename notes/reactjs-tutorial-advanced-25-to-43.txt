# 25 - Fragments.
    Fragments allows you to group a list of children to the DOM without wrapping them with a parent node or component.
    With fragments, we can wrap a group of children components or JSX, so that they are rendered without a parent.
    Syntax:
        >>> <React.Fragment>
                <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
                <SomeComponent />
                <div>We are all rendered without a parent</div>
            </React.Fragment>
    Fragments also accept a unique "key" prop which is useful when rendering list items, but you do not want to wrap
    the content of the UI JSX.
    Example:
        >>> const items = [...];   // some list of items
            const itemList = items.map(item => (
                <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
                    <h1>{item.title}</h1>
                    <p>{item.content}</p>
                </React.Fragment>
            ));
    A shorter syntax to <React.Fragment> is an empty tag: <> showing that the child components or JSX are not wrapped
    by a parent component or JSX. This shorter syntax, however, does not accept the unique "key" props.
